## Color Contrast Monitoring for Dark Mode
ðŸš¨ **Work in Progress** ðŸš¨

The provided scripts are designed to monitor color contrast issues, specifically for dark mode. The process involves creating test cases based on the top Wikipedia articles and running accessibility tests using ~~[pa11y](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci)~~ [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core). The results are logged to the console and a CSV file, capturing color contrast violations.
